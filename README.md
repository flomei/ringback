# Ringback â€“ a lightweight event dispatcher

## Functionality

Essentially similar to `EventTarget`, but with the added possibility to attach the same handler more than once to the same event and the ability to call callbacks with arbitrary arguments.

## Installation

Ringback can be added to your project via npm:

```sh
npm install ringback
```

## Usage

This package exposes one default class. Import it accordingly.

CommonJS:
```javascript
const Ringback = require('ringback');
```
ES6+:
```javascript
import Ringback from 'ringback';
```

### Methods

#### constructor()

The constructor takes no arguments.

#### subscribe(eventName, callback[, preventMultipleSubscriptions = true])

Adds a callback to a specific event.
* `eventName` is a string value identifying the event.
* `callback` is a function which is to be called once and event with the name of the `eventName` parameter is dispatched.
* If `preventMultipleSubscriptions` is truthy, it is not possible to add a callback more than once to an event of a name. It is `true` by default to be consistent with `EventTarget`.

#### unsubscribe(eventName, callback)

Removes *all* callbacks for a specific event.
* `eventName` is a string value identifying the event.
* `callback` is a function which is to be removed for this event. Be careful that *all* callbacks will be removed, not just one.

#### publish(eventName[, ...callbackArguments])

Calls all callbacks for a certain events with an arbitrary amount of arguments.
* `eventName` is a string value identifying the event.
* `callbackArguments` is an arbitrary list of arguments.

#### clearAll()

Removes all callbacks and essentially resets the whole instance to its original state.

### Examples

#### Call callbacks with arguments

```javascript
import Ringback from 'ringback';

const dispatcher = new Ringback();

const multiplicationHandler = (factorA, factorB) => {
    console.log(factorA * factorB);
};

dispatcher.subscribe('multiplication', multiplicationHandler);

dispatcher.publish('multiplication', 5, 4);

/*
    Outputs:
    20
*/
```

#### Adding multiple identical callbacks to the same event

```javascript
import Ringback from 'ringback';

const dispatcher = new Ringback();

const logA = () => {
    console.log('A');
};

const logB = () => {
    console.log('B');
};

dispatcher.subscribe('logA', logA);
dispatcher.subscribe('logA', logA);

dispatcher.subscribe('logB', logB);
dispatcher.subscribe('logB', logB, false);
/* This callback will be added,
   because preventMultipleSubscriptions is false */
dispatcher.subscribe('logB', logB);
/* This callback will NOT be added,
   because preventMultipleSubscriptions is true */

dispatcher.publish('logA');
dispatcher.publish('logB');

/*
    Outputs:
    "A"
    "B"
    "B"
*/
```
